                      <li>The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand.</li>
                      <li>The first round is started by a randomly selected player. All subsequent rounds begin with the current president playing the first card.</li>
                      <li>When it is your turn, you must either match/beat the rank of the previous card player,
                          or pass your turn. (Note that you can pass on any turn, even if you are able to play.)</li>
                      <li>You must play the number of cards the first player plays. If the first player plays a single card, you must play a single card. 
                          If the second player plays an identical pair of cards, you must play an identical pair of cards. Etc.</li>
                      <li>If you are unable to beat the previous card or cards played and cannot clear the pile, you must pass.</li>
                      <li>Playing a <code>2</code> clears the middle pile. The player who played the <code>2</code>
                          plays again to start the new pile.</li>
                      <li>If every player passes and play returns to the player who played the passed on card, 
                          the cards are cleared, and a new pile is started by the player who played the passed on card.</li>
                      <li>If a player is able to complete a 4-of-a-kind into the middle, that player can do so, even if he/she is playing out of turn. When there is a 4-of-a-kind in the middle, 
                          the pile is cleared. The player that completed the 4-of-a-kind starts the new pile.</li>
                      <li>The first player to play all his/her cards is considered the president, while the second player to do so is considered the vice president.
                          Conversely, the last player to play all his/her cards is considered the A-hole, while the second to last player to do so is considered the Vice A-hole.</li>
                      <li>Before the next round begins, the President must ask the A-hole for two cards. The A-hole must give the President those
                          cards if they have them; if not, the President can ask for different card(s). The same applies to the Vice-President and Vice A-hole,
                          although the Vice-President only asks for one card (and, accordingly, the Vice A-hole only gives up one card.)</li>
                      <li>The President of the round is awarded 2 points, and the Vice-President of the round is awarded 1 point. The first player to 11 points wins the game.</li>

                        <li>The starting player plays their desired initial combo of cards. Multi-card plays must be identical cards in rank.</li>
                        <li>When it is their turn, a player can either a) play cards that match or beat the rank of the previous card(s) played
                            and are in the same number of cards as the first player played, or b) pass their turn.</li>
                        <li>The pile is cleared if a player plays a <code>2</code> (on their turn), or completes a 4-of-a-kind (at any time.) A new pile is then started by the player who played the 
                            <code>2</code> / completed the 4-of-a-kind. Otherwise, round play continues until every player passes and play returns to the player who played the passed on card.
                            Then, the cards are cleared, and a new pile is started by the player who played the passed on card.</li>
                        <li>Play continues until everyone has gotten rid of their cards. The first player to play all his/her cards is considered the president, while the second player to do so is considered the vice president.
                            Conversely, the last player to play all his/her cards is considered the A-hole, while the second to last player to do so is considered the Vice A-hole. The President of the round is awarded 2 points, 
                            and the Vice-President of the round is awarded 1 point.</li>
                        <li>In between rounds, the President and A-hole trade two cards, while the Vice-President and Vice A-hole trade one card.</li>
                        <li>Another round starts with the previous round's President as the starting player. 
                            This order of play continues until a single winner is determined (ie, a player reaches 11 points.)</li>
