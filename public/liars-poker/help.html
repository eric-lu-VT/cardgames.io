                <h1>What is Liar's Poker?</h1>

                <h3>It's Poker... but you're guessing hands among all players!</h3>

                <h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each player starts the game with a certain number of cards, 
                    determined by how many players there are at the start of the game. 
                    (There are also five cards in the middle in HOLD_EM mode.)</li>
                    <li>Each person takes turns guessing what they think is the 
                    highest poker hand among all cards in play in the round.</li>
                    <li>Players each make guesses, with each guess being better in Poker 
                    rank than the previous, until a player decides to challenge the 
                    previous player's claim.</li>
                    <li>If the last hand guessed exists by combining all the cards 
                    in play in the round, the challenger (the current player) loses the 
                    round; if it doesn't exist, the previous player loses the round.</li>
                    <li>When a player loses a round, they get another card for all future 
                    rounds they're in, which helps... but if you get too many cards 
                    (again determined by how many players there are at the start of 
                    the game), you're out.</li>
                    <li>Last person standing wins!</li>
                    </ul>
                </h5>
                
                <h3>Order of play:</h3>

                <h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Players are dealt their respective number of cards (varies) 
                        and five cards to the middle in HOLD_EM mode.</li>
                        <li>The starting player and order of play is randomized.</li>
                        <li>When it is their turn, the player can either a) propose a 
                        new hand that contains one to five cards and is also better 
                        in Poker rank than the previous hand, or b) challenge the 
                        previous player's claim.</li>
                        <li>Round play continues until a player challenges.</li>
                        <li>When a player challenges, all the cards in play 
                        (among all players and the cards in the middle) are used to see if 
                        the last guess can be made from them. If yes, the current player 
                        (the player who challenged) loses the round; if no, the previous 
                        player (the player who got challenged) loses the round.</li>
                        <li>Whoever lost the round gets another card. If they get 
                        six cards, they are eliminated from the game.</li>
                        <li>Another round starts with the remaining players still alive in 
                        the game. This order of play continues until a single winner 
                        is determined.</li>
                    </ol>
